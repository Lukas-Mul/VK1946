          The expulsion of three million Germans took place in the years 1945-46. This decision was made due to the cruel treatment of Czechs by the Nazis during the Protectorate and the hardships during the Second World War. The principle <br>of collective guilt was applied. 
          Czechoslovakia thus lost <br>a significant number <br>of inhabitants, many of them highly qualified.

          <p>7,099,411 voters took part in the elections in Czechoslovakia.</p> 
          <br>
          <p>The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was defeated in Slovakia, but in the whole country it was victorious. In total, it won 43.3% of the vote.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Land redistribution, a positive perception of the Soviet Union, and resulting expectations of a new, more socially just system, played a major role. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The National Socialists finished second with 25.2% of the vote. They were <br>the opposite of the Communists, but their programme probably failed to resonate in rural areas.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The People’s Party hoped for a higher number of voters in rural areas, but it had <br>to make do with only 16.3% of the vote. This was the beginning of the party’s internal problems.</p>             
          <br>
          <p>Social Democrats got only 15% of the vote despite having a very similar programme <br>to the Communists.</p>             
          <br>
          <p>The 1946 elections were the last free democratic elections in the next forty years.</p>
